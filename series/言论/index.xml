      <description>​ This is the second time to build my blogs since my website was not running one year ago. Last year, work tasks takes over my life completely. There was a month when I worked 160 hours of overtime and the average overtime hours were more than 120 hours in other four month.
​ That&amp;rsquo;s crazy and terrifying. I think about work only and other things are missing. so, I set up a blog again when after finishing my work now.</description>
