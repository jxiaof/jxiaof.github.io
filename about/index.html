        <p>This is the second time to build my blogs since my website was not running one year ago. The work task takes over my last year completely. There was a month when I worked 160 hours of overtime and the average overtime hours were more than 120 hours. that&rsquo;s crazy and terrifying. I think about work only and other things are missing. so, I set up a blog again when after finishing my work now. I wish to meet some peeson interesting and do something cool after now. Awesome.</p>
<p>Now, a new website is here! It&rsquo;s a time machine about my work, my picture, music, and videos.</p>
